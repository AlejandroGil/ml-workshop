# MLOps workshop

In this workshop you'll implement and experiment a basic MLOps process, supported by an automated infrastructure for training/testing/deploying/integrating ML Models.

It is comprised by four parts:

1. You'll start with a WarmUp, for reviewing the basic features of Amazon Sagemaker
2. Then you will create a basic Docker Image for supporting any scikit-learn model
3. Then you will create a dispatcher Docker Image that supports two different algorithms
4. Finally you will train the models, deploy them into a DEV environment, approve and deploy them into a PRD environment with High Availability and elasticity
