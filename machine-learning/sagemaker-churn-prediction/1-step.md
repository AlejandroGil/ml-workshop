# Churn prediction with SageMaker

In the world of business, _customer churn_ refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company. Thus, it would be nice for a company to be able to predict it and take action before it happens. In this lab you will build, train and deploy a model based on the XGBoost algorithm that will be used to predict customer churn.

XGBoost is a popular framework used to perform [gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), which is a supervised learning algorithm for regression and classification. SageMaker comes with a built-in implementation of XGBoost ready for you to use.
