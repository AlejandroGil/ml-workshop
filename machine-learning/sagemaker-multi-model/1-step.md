# SageMaker multi-model endpoints

The [SageMaker multi-model endpoints capability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/multi-model-endpoints.html) allows you to host multiple models in a single endpoint, using the same inference container. This can tanslate into significant cost savings and better resource utilization.

In this lab you will learn how to do this by hosting two recommendation models based on XGBoost, one for movies and one for music.
