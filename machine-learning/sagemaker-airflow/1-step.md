# Sagemaker Airflow workshop

On this workshop you will build, manage and orchestrate Machine Learning workflows using [Amazon Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), leveraging Sagemaker operators for Airflow.

You will build a recommender system to predict a customer's rating for a certain video based on customer's historical ratings of similar videos as well as the behavior of other similar customers. You'll use historical star ratings from over 2M Amazon customers on over 160K digital videos, taken from the [AWS Public Datasets page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html).

Here is the high-level depiction of the ML workflow you will implement for building the recommender system:
