# SageMaker Autopilot and SageMaker Experiments

Autopilot is a SageMaker feature that automatically trains and tunes the best machine learning models for classification or regression based on your data, while allowing you to maintain full control and visibility.

You provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, which can be a number (regression) or a category (classification). Autopilot will then analyze and explore different solutions to find the best model, which can be deployed with a single click or further improved manually.
