During the lab you will:
* Setup and install the basics required for capturing video from a camera, like e.g. your laptop webcam.
* Configure the Cloud Formation template for your prototype.
* Deploy the Lambda function for your prototype.
* Play with the demo graphical interface, detecting objects in the video.
* Delete the resources when you are done.
