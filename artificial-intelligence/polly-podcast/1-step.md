# Polly podcast

In this introductory lab you will learn how to connect [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) with a RSS feed, so you can listen to your favorite blogs instead of reading them.

The main steps involved will be:
* Setting up an Amazon S3 bucket.
* Create an AWS Lambda function to use it for calling Amazon Polly.
* Setup an Amazon CloudWatch event for triggering the Lambda.
* Test your demo with a RSS feed.
