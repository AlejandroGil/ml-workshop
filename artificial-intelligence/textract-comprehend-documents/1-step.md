# Textract and Comprehend for documents analysis

In this lab, you will learn how to get text and data from documents with Amazon Textract, analyze entities on these with Amazon Comprehend, and indexing the documents for further search with Amazon Elasticseach.

For this exercise you will work with the **Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 flight journals**, the two well-known travels to the moon.

The main steps involved will be:
* Setup the environment.
* Setup the Lambda for calling the Textract API.
* Extract the entities with Comprehend.
* Index the documents with Elasticsearch.
* Cleanup when you are done.
